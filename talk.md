- [**The Effective Operator Basis of the HEFT**](https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/20782/contributions/146418/)
(第十七届TeV工作组学术研讨会，南京)

	The Higgs effective field theory (HEFT) is an effective field theory in the broken phase, providing a more general realization of the EW symmetry breaking, which includes the SMEFT as a particular case. There are more effective operators than the SMEFT and can be matched to the latter ones. I will discuss the HEFT, especially its effective operators basis. The key points are
	
	- A general method to construct effective operators utilizing the Young diagrams and its applications to the HEFT, including the management of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons and the spurions;
	- The Hilbert series method extended to the nonlinear symmetry and the discrete symmetries such as the parity and charge conjugation, and its applications to the HEFT to count effective operators.

	The light bosons like axion, ALP and dark photon can be regarded as dark matter candidates, and the EFT descriptions of them are all about Goldstone bosons, thus they can be treated simultaneously.

	- The axion and ALP are Goldstone boson originate from some global symmetry, their extension to the standard model is constructed.
	- The dark photon is a massive vector boson and can be described by the Stueckelberg mechanism, where are Golstone boson is included. The EFT containing it is similar to the chiral Lagrangian of Low-energy QCD.

	In particular, we construct the higher dimension operators of these EFTs, which will play an important role in the high-loop calculations and the high-luminosity experiments.

	The chiral effective field theory (CHEFT) describes the strong and electroweak interactions at a low-energy scale. The effective operators of the CHEFT are the invariants under the chiral symmetry and the Lorentz symmetry, which can be constructed via the Young tensor method efficiently. Besides, the electroweak interactions are considered by developing the leptons as degrees of freedom of the CHEFT and introducing one more U(1) symmetry and some spurions to guarantee the conservation of the electric charges. With the management above, the effective operator basis can be obtained, and they can be matched to the high-energy theory such as the LEFT or SMEFT naturally.
